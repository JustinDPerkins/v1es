### (Risk) Surface-Level Proactivity

By understanding the challenges inherent to digital transformation, organizations can take a proactive approach to attack surface risk management (ASRM) in order to discover, assess, and mitigate the risks associated with their environment. It is important to note the mindset distinction between (a.) traditional asset discovery and monitoring versus (b.) ASRM; the latter evaluates security gaps — including risks across people, processes, and technology — from the attacker's perspective.

#### Discovery

Total visibility requires insights into known, unknown, internal and internet-facing (external) assets, and these definitions are constantly stretching and changing in the modern business; new projects, with their own sets of unique open-source dependencies and user/device accounts, require visibility to update alongside the ecosystem, not after the fact. Total visibility provides answers to questions like the following:

- What is my attack surface?
- How well can I see what assets are in my environment? 
- How many, what types, and what attributes are associated with these assets?
- What are my high-value assets?
- How is my attack surface changing?

#### Assessment

Once total and real-time visibility of the business has been implemented, aspects like systems, user types, and processes can be evaluated for potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and these are far reaching: certain operating system versions may be susceptible to exploit; executive level employees are common targets for business email compromise (BEC); and DevOps pipelines are becoming increasingly targeted in campaigns. Contextualizing all potential business risks helps answer the following:

- Can I quantify my risk? What is my overall risk score?
- Is my risk score increasing or decreasing over time?
- How does it compare to peers in the industry?
- Where do I see the most significant security risks?
- What risk factors need immediate attention?

#### Mitigation

Closing the attack surface risk lifecycle is mitigation, the application of practices that lower the risk exposure from data collected during discovery and assessment. These practices can include implementing virtual patches based on discovered vulnerable operating systems, aligning prevention controls and configurations, and controlling user access parameters. Like the other parts of the ASRM lifecycle, mitigation succeeds when it is automated as much as possible to increase efficiency and decrease the chance of an attack or breach attempt from succeeding.

#### Summary

Automating the proactive ASRM lifecycle is one half of an effective security strategy for the modern business; mapping assets in discovery and having mitigation workflows in place reduces the scope of investigation and improves triage protocols for the security operations center (SOC) of the business, allowing the SOC to efficiently detect, investigate, and respond to higher fidelity security events.
