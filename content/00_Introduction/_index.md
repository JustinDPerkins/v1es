## Security at the Speed of Business

### Overview

The security landscape is becoming increasingly complex as it expands and contracts with evolving business structures. Hybrid work environments result from the convergence of user workstations, public cloud infrastructure, SaaS and cloud native applications, and IT/OT devices, blurring traditional security perimeters as business focuses constantly shift from one project to the next.

The crossroads of business and security meet at servers, the workhorse of the enterprise. Gartner, the leading IT research and advisory firm, explicitly points out that “Servers often host the most critical data in the enterprise and have different functionality than client endpoints.” The challenge is that the architectural shifts have established server workloads in multiple locations and in different formats, which makes securing them more complex than ever before.

The proliferation of connected devices, expected to grow to 55.9+ billion worldwide by 2025, can leave underprepared security teams on the back foot as skills and personnel shortages divide limited focus across seemingly infinite alerts. Bridging the gap between the business and security landscapes requires both proactive and reactive approaches to close a security loop, where continuous discovery of attack surface and risks create effective detection and response workflows that in turn drive new mitigation recommendations and risk assessments.
