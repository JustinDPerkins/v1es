### About Vision One

Trend Vision One is a cloud-native security operations platform, combining Attack Surface Risk Management (ASRM) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) capabilities in a single console to effectively manage cyber security across an organization, while supporting Zero Trust strategies.

Vision One uses a native-first hybrid approach for XDE and ASRM to provide rich telemetry to understand the full context across security layers.

### Attack Surface Risk Management

The attack surface consists of all the cyber assets connected within your organization and all possible attack vectors. Each entry point into the organization is an opportunity for breach. Digital transformation and the move to hybrid or remote work across many organizations has accelerated the size, scope, and composition of the attack surface.

### Zero Trust Strategies

Zero Trust Secure Access, secures all access across internal and cloud applications and environments from any user, device, location, at any time.

By eliminating the excessive trust placed on networks and locations and by providing device-aware, identity-based, and rule-powered access control, Zero Trust Secure Access enables adaptive, automated decisions on private and internet access to mitigate, detect, and respond to risks in the network environments.

### Extended Detection and Response: XDR

Extended Detection and Response collects and correlates data across multiple security layers:

``` endpoint | server | email | identity | mobile | cloud workload | network ```

Security analysts can detect, investigate, and respond to individual events and cross-layer attacks through these views:

- **Workbench view**: Visualize the full story of an attack, run a root cause analysis, look at the execution profile, identify the scope of impact and take response actions from a single app.

- **Incident view**: Group together related Workbench alerts and view the end-to-end execution profile of an incident with advanced alert correlation and machine learning techniques.

- **Root cause analysis**: Understand and investigate an individual alert and advanced persistent threats (APT).
